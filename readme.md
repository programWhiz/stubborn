# Stubborn – a test assertion and matcher library for Jai

Stubborn is a first attempt at porting [Hamjest](https://github.com/rluba/hamjest) to Jai.
It’s still very, *very*, **veeery** early and contains only a handful of matchers, but it already supports …

* … enumerating and running all tests at compile-time.
* … parameterized tests
* … compile errors that point to the failed assertion

Unfortunately, I haven’t found an elegant way to support nesting of matchers yet. Baby steps.

# Writing tests

Tests are normal functions annotated with `@Test` inside any file ending in `.spec.jai`:

```Jai
// visit_files.spec.jai
your_test_function_with_a_descriptive_name :: () {

} @Test
```

Use `assert_that(actualValue, matcher)` to write test assertions:

```Jai
// visit_files.spec.jai
ignores_dirs_and_follows_links_by_default :: () {
	result: [..] string;
	defer cleanup(result);

	success := visit_files("tests/links", true, *result, (info: *File_Visit_Info, result: * [..] string) {
		array_add(result, copy_string(info.full_name));
	});

	assert_that(success, is(true));
	assert_that(result, contains_in_any_order(
		"tests/links/link_dir/file.txt",
		"tests/links/real_dir/file.txt",
		"tests/links/linked.txt",
		"tests/links/broken_link"
	));
} @Test
```

The first failing assertion will stop compilation with an error at the line of the assert.
See [Matchers](#Matchers) for a list of available matchers.

## Parameterized tests

You probably want to parameterize some of your tests to avoid repeating the same test code over and over again.
Simply provide a global array with the parameters thats called like your test function + `_params` and let your test function take an argument:

```Jai
// count_a.spec.jai

Count_Test_Args :: struct {
	input: string;
	expected: int;
}

counts_number_of_as_correctly_params :: Count_Test_Args.[
	.{"jonathan", 2},
	.{"raphael", 2},
	.{"jim", 0},
	.{"jane", 1},
];

counts_number_of_as_correctly :: (args: Count_Test_Args) {
	result := count_a(args.input);

	assert_that(result, is(args.expected));
} @Test
```

Running the tests will (hopefully) output:

```
count_a.spec.jai:
	counts_number_of_as_correctly({"jonathan", 2}): PASSED
	counts_number_of_as_correctly({"raphael", 2}): PASSED
	counts_number_of_as_correctly({"jim", 0}): PASSED
	counts_number_of_as_correctly({"jane", 1}): PASSED
```

# Running the tests

`#load` (not `#import`!) the [run.jai](./run.jai) as part of you build file and call `build_tests(…)`:

```Jai
#load "modules/stubborn/run.jai";

#run {
    args := get_build_options().compile_time_command_line;

	entrypoint := ifx args.count then args[0] else "";
	if entrypoint == "test" {
        options := get_build_options();
		build_tests(options, "<path_to_your_test_folder>", #string END
			// Any code or modules that should be loaded before the tests are run goes here…
			// For example:
			#load "your_main_entry_file.jai";
		END, <paths to custom modules go here>);
	} else {
		// Your normal build stuff goes here…
	}
}
```

Stubborn will recursively enumerate all files ending in `.spec.jai` inside the folder you pass to `build_tests`, compile them, find all methods annotated with `@Test` and run them.

Tests will be run in the lexicographical order of their file names and in the order they’re define inside each file.

The first failing assertion stops compilation.

You can also compile the tests into a binary instead of running them at compile time by passing `run = false` to `build_tests`. (Useful for stepping through your tests with a debugger.)

## Skipping tests
You can run only a sub-set of tests by passing a list of test names as `args` to `build_tests`.

# Matchers

For now, this module contains only a minimal set of [Hamjest’s](https://github.com/rluba/hamjest) matchers:

* `is(expected_value)` for any type
* `contains(.. expected_values)` for arrays
* `contains_in_any_order(.. expected_values` for arrays
* `has_count` for anything with a `.count` member (arrays, strings, collections, …)

None of the matchers support nesting, yet.
